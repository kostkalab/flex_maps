# Mouse (Mus musculus) configuration

species_code: mmu
name: Mus musculus

# Minimum fraction of module enzymes that must map to species genes
min_enzyme_coverage: 0.66

# Modules to include even without species-specific KEGG submaps
# These are metabolically important and have sufficient enzyme coverage
rescue_modules:
  # Tier 1: High confidence
  - M00104 # Bile acid biosynthesis (Cholesterol => Cholate)
  - M00088 # Ketone body biosynthesis, acetyl-CoA => acetoacetate/3-hydroxybutyrate/acetone 
  - M00978 # Ornithine-ammonia cycle 
  - M00843 # L-threo-Tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, GTP => L-threo-BH4
  - M00367 # C10-C20 isoprenoid biosynthesis, non-plant eukaryotes 

# Modules to exclude even if coverage threshold is met
